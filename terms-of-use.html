        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>


        <p>Last updated: January 07, 2019</p>


        <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern your relationship with https://no-filter.app/ website and NoFilter mobile application (the "Service") operated by NoFilter ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

        <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using our website and NoFilter mobile application (the "Service").</p>

        <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>

        <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>




        <h2>Subscriptions</h2>

        <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>

        <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or NoFilter cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting NoFilter customer support team.</p>

        <p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide NoFilter with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize NoFilter to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>

        <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, NoFilter will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>




        <h2>Fee Changes</h2>

        <p>NoFilter, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>

        <p>NoFilter will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

        <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>


        <h2>Refunds</h2>

        <p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by NoFilter on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of NoFilter.</p>

        <p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

        <p>You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trade mark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than you without appropriate authorization, or a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene.</p>
